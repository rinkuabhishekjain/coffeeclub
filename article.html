Exploring Popular Brewing Methods
While the pour-over method shown above is a favorite for its ability to highlight a coffee's nuanced flavors, there are many other ways to brew, each offering a unique taste profile.

Pour-Over (e.g., Hario V60, Chemex):

How it works: You manually pour hot water over coffee grounds in a filter, and the brewed coffee drips into a vessel below.

Why we love it: It allows for precise control over brewing variables like water temperature, pour rate, and bloom time, resulting in a clean, complex, and aromatic cup.

French Press:

How it works: Coarse coffee grounds are steeped in hot water for several minutes, then a plunger with a mesh filter is pressed down to separate the grounds from the brewed coffee.

Why we love it: It's a simple, full-immersion method that produces a full-bodied and robust cup of coffee. It's also great for brewing multiple cups at once.

AeroPress:

How it works: Coffee and water are mixed in a chamber, and then air pressure is used to force the brew through a filter into a cup.

Why we love it: It's incredibly versatile, allowing you to brew everything from a concentrated espresso-style shot to a lighter, filter-style coffee. It's also durable and portable, making it perfect for travel.

Tips for Better Brewing
No matter which method you choose, there are a few universal tips that will improve your coffee:

Use Fresh Beans: Coffee is best when it's freshly roasted. Try to buy beans from a local roaster and grind them just before brewing.

Mind Your Water: Coffee is mostly water, so use filtered water if your tap water has a strong taste. The ideal water temperature is between 195°F and 205°F (90°C - 96°C).

Get the Ratio Right: A good starting point is a 1:16 ratio of coffee to water (e.g., 20 grams of coffee to 320 grams of water). You can adjust this to your taste.

Experiment: The beauty of coffee brewing is that there's no single "right" way. Don't be afraid to experiment with different beans, grind sizes, and brewing methods to find what you enjoy most.
